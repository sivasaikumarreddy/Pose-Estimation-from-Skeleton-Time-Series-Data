# Pose-Estimation-from-Skeleton-Time-Series-Data


### Project Goal :
The aim of this project is to use time series of 3D skeleton data, collected from multiple subjects performing a variety of activities.

The task is to develop a model that can accurately predict the future positions of the skeleton joints given the past positions.
